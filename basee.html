    <h2>A1. Base E</h2>
    <p>Tired of using decimal? We, International Base E Society can fix it. The 14dec-base system is relatively satire, but we make it work. The systematic names "Tetradecimal" is a joke, and it uses base decimal anyways. Welcome to our base-neutral base, <strong>E.</strong></p>
    <p>so how does it work? SImple. we got our digits for decimal, 0123456789, and 4 new alphanumeric digits, abcd. Hex has 6 new digits, and dozenal has 2. dek and el, ↊ or ↋. we could use something called the "argam numerals" for base e, but [flock] you.</p>
    <p>the numbers goes like; <i>0: nil, 1: unt, 2: e, 3: /θeð/, 4: brs, 5: entnil, 6: cwl, 7: flock, 8: unsept, 9: unoctet, a: alpha, b: beta, c: gamma, d: delta.</i> 10 is <i>duodozen,</i> and 20 is <i>biduodozen.</i> for 11-1d, we take out "en" and put the units in the end, so 17 is duodozflock. the multiples of 10 is easy, since you add a specific prefix. 2-9 are the same you use in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">elements,</a> 2 is bi, 3 is tri, 4 is quad, 5 is pent, 6 is hex, 7 is sept, 8 is oct, 9 is enn. The rest of them are: a is sucenn, b is vet, c is calf and d is dent. so c0 is calfduodozen, 4a is quadduodozalpha and 11 is duodozunt.</p>
    <p>NOW, time for the big numbers. 100 is heptominan, and for anything above 100, remove the last letter "n". 101 is heptominaunt. multiples are the same as 10s. so 5dc is pentheptominadentduodozecalf, and 600 is hexheptominan. for 1000, its <strong>unt-untfinnio</strong> or just <strong>untfinnio.</strong> 1001 is untfinnio-unt, and 101d is untfinnio-duodozdelta. 2000 is <i>e-untfinnio</i> and 10000 is <i>duodozen-untfinnio.</i></p>
